      <h2>About this Project</h2>
      <p>
        As a BI Developer for Mavy Tech, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance and provided actionable recommendations to improve team's performance and increase sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mavy Tech is a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform.

      <h2>The Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset contained records exported from MavenTech's CRM from October 2016 to December 2017. 
        It held details of opportunities with associated information such as product, account, and 
        whether the sale was won or lost.

      <h2>Key Assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        When creating a dashboard/report, I always work with business owners to make sure I 
        truly understand the intended purpose and the questions they seek to answer.  
        In this report I made the following key assumptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sales managers want to view the current state of play for their team and obtain actionable insights.</li>
        <li>Key questions include:
          <ul>
            <li>How is my team tracking against KPIs?</li>
            <li>Are there team members who require extra support?</li>
            <li>Where should I focus efforts to improve performance?</li>
            <li>Is my team performing above average compared to the rest of the business?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Main KPI: Dollar value of sales made.</li>
        <li>Other important metrics: number of sales, conversion %, average sales value.</li>
        <li>Managers may want to compare performance across teams or over time.</li>
        <li>Focus is on team-level dashboards rather than executive-level comparisons.</li>
        <li>Assumed "Current quarter" is Q4 2017, but dashboard would update continuously in practice.</li>
      </ul>
