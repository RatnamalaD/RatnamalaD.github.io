# PowerBI-Portfolio
# About this project

**Objective:**

As a BI Developer for Mavy Tech, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance and provided actionable recommendations to improve team performance and increase sales.
Mavy Tech is a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities, but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform.

**The Dataset:**

The dataset contained records exported from Mavy Tech's CRM from October 2016 to December 2017. It held details of opportunities with associated information such as product, account, and whether the sale was won or lost.

**Key Assumptions:**

Their main KPI is the dollar value of sales made, however related metrics such as number of sales, win %, and average sales value are also important and help to understand their total sales value.
They may also, at times, want to dive deeper and look at their team's performance over the year or in comparison to other sales teams.
As the dashboard is intended for sales managers, the most important view for them is to see their own team, rather than an Executive dashboard with higher-level team comparisons. They may, however, like to look at other sales teams in more detail, and there is no requirement for row-level security to prevent them from accessing other team data.

It is assumed that the "Current quarter" is Q4 2017, which is the latest period recorded in the dataset; however, in reality, this dashboard would continuously update over time as new data is added.
